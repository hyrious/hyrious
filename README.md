<p align="center">Hi, I'm hyrious.</p>

- I recently focus on front-end related things because of job.
- I also have interests in game-making related skills.
- I like writing <ins>silent languages</ins> because fingers will complain if they work too much.

<blockquote><dl>
    <dt>Silent Languages</dt>
    <dd>Those who don't force users to provide every obvious & trivial details of any piece of code of a program.<br /><em>i.e.</em> Given some programming language,<br />if it has static type checking system then it should do its best to infer types instead of let users mark.<br />Otherwise, it at least should make a program correct instead of wrong at most of the time, which requires the language to be designed properly to make programmers happy instead of let them yell <q>wtfâ€½</q>.<p align="right">&mdash;&mdash; Me said that.</p></dd>
