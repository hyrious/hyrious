$ E = mc^2 - \LaTeX $

$$ e^{ \pm i\theta } = \cos \theta \pm i\sin \theta $$

There's a little bug in inline latex expressions, you can only trigger it via either:

- Put no spaces before/after `$` symbols, i.e. `$E=mc^2$` is ok, `$ E=mc^2 $`, `$E=mc^2 $`, `$ E=mc^2$` won't work.
- `$ E=mc^2 $` works if it forms the whole paragraph. (but that's useless, right?)
